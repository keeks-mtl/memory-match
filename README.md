# Memory Match

## Goal For This Project

Welcome from Memory Match!

## Table of Contents

## UX

An important aspect of the planning for this project was the element of User-Experience. Directing the planning of the project through a User-Experience approach created a useful guide to understand the user's needs and streamline the development of the site. Through visiting Memory Match, it was important to create a positive user experience.

### User Goals

### Wireframes

- [Wireframes](link): A 6 page website.

### Design Choices

### Fonts

- The goal was an overall cohesive feeling to the website so I decided not to use multiple fonts, choosing the font 'Roboto'.
- I wanted something contemporary but also clean & clear. The font was chosen from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to make sure it worked across browsers/devices.

## Deployment

This project has been deployed using GitHub pages and I have used the following process to do so:

### Publishing

-

### Forking

You can fork a project to make a copy without it affecting the main branch with this process:

- Log in to GitHub and find the repository that you wish to fork
- Clicked on the repository and on the top right-hand side you will see three options: 'unwatch' 'star' and 'fork'
- Once the fork button has been clicked, a copy of the repository will be in your Github account

### Cloning

You can clone the repository to your local device following these steps:

- Choose the Github repository that you'd like
- Click the 'code' button at the top right next to 'add file'
- Copy the link that pops up
- Open your terminal and choose the directory you would like the clone to be in
- Type 'git clone' and paste the URL you copied afterwards and then click enter
